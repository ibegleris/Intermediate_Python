NGCM Summer Academy 2016 - Intermediate Python
==============================================

Material in this repository is created for the purpose of teaching Python programming concepts to extend that of the [Software Carpentry led basics course](https://github.com/softwaresaved/NGCMGSoton-2015-06-21), such as

* Tuples
* Dictionaries
* Object-oriented programming
* Generators
* Decorators

These topics should prepare the reader for the [Summer Academy IPython course](https://github.com/jupyter/ngcm-tutorial) having already participated in a similar SWC-style basics course.

Getting Started
---------------
Teaching material is largely in Jupyter Notebook format, and can be followed in several ways (in order of preference):

1. Cloning this repository with 

  > `git clone https://github.com/ngcm/summer-academy-2016.git`

  and viewing the 'Index.ipynb' as a live notebook slideshow with

  > `jupyter notebook Index.ipynb`

  This requires the [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) package to be installed.

2. Clone (as in 1.) and view the slides as a raw notebook (`View > Cell Toolbar > Raw Cell Format`)

3. Clone (as in 1.) and view the static html slideshow with

  > `make serve`

4. Viewing directly on Github (not recommended)
